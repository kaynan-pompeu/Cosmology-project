# Cosmology-project
These are the codes used to create the figures for my first cosmology project. It solves the Boltzmann hierarchy equations using CAMB for a hybrid dark sector model explores, mostly, the background evolution of various components and the dark energy equation of state. It also provides tools for constraining the model's parameters using MCMC.
