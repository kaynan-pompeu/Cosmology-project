# Cosmology-project
These are the codes used to create the figures for my first cosmology project. It solves the Boltzmann hierarchy equations using CAMB for a hybrid dark sector model explores, mostly, the background evolution of various components and the dark energy equation of state. It also provides tools for constraining the model's parameters using MCMC.

The modified CAMB version I am using can be found in https://github.com/joaoreboucas1/CAMB-HDS.git and it is based on the model presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13653. To run the files it is necessary to clone the repository and compile both the fortran file and the camb file. For windows users I suggest employing a subsystem for Linux (like WSL).
